24a2 is a simple game engine that lets you to build a game in a few hours. It has a very limited set of features which makes it easy to learn, and encourages you to solve problems creatively.

24a2 games are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) and are played in a web browser, so you can easily share what you’ve created.

All 24a2 games feature a 24 by 24 grid of dots. You can set the color of each dot, and read the color of each dot back. 24a2 can also run a function you define when an arrow key is pressed, or when a dot is clicked on.

That’s about it! There are a few other features, which you can find out about in the [tutorial](https://24a2.routley.io/tutorial/) and the [API reference](https://24a2.routley.io/reference/).

Using 24a2 means you don’t have to think about the visual style of your game, complicated physics or sound - you can just focus on actually building something.

Please see our [website for more information, examples, and a tutorial](https://24a2.routley.io/)
